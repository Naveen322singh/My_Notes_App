🚀 Excited to share my latest project – a Note-Taking App built using Kotlin and XML in Android Studio! 📝📱

This app is designed to provide a smooth and efficient note-taking experience with essential features like:
✅ Add, Edit, Update, Delete & Search Notes 🔍
✅ MVVM Architecture for clean and maintainable code
✅ Room Database (DAO, Entity, Repository) for local storage
✅ Coroutines for background tasks and efficient database operations
✅ Data Binding to simplify UI updates and improve performance
✅ Navigation Component & Fragments for seamless user experience
✅ RecyclerView with CardView & Grid Layouts for intuitive UI
✅ Menus & Alert Dialogs for easy interaction

Working on this project helped me dive deeper into Jetpack components, UI/UX design, database management, asynchronous programming, and efficient UI handling. Looking forward to learning more and improving it further!

Would love to hear your thoughts! Feel free to drop feedback or suggestions. 🚀✨
